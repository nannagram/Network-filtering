# Network-filtering
Repository for the filtering of complex networks. It includes codes to generate network from Erdós-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert models, the algorithms of four filter and wide range of tool to compare and analyze their performance. 

The repository is divided in 4 branches: 

- BA_networks
This branch containes the code that create BA networks, it is possible to create them undirected, directed, binary and weighted.

# ER_network
This repository is analogous to the previous one but for the ER networks

# Filtering_algorithms
This repository containes the functions that implement 4 different filters: 
The Hypergeometric filter ( Mantegna et al.)
The Disparity filter ( Serrano, Bogu ̃n ́a, & Vespignani)
The Pólya filter ( Marcaccioli & Livan)
The Max Entropy filter ( Squartini, MAstrandrea & Garlaschelli )
